Are you a TV addict, and want to keep track of all the shows you've binge-watched and movies you saw? Traktivity is for you!

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to log your watched TV series on Trakt.tv.

Right now it only logs data. In the next version you will get ways to display that data on your site.

**Questions, problems?**

Take a look at the *Installation* and *FAQ* tabs here. If that doesn't help, [post in the support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/traktivity).

**Credits**

The Traktivity plugin gets most its data from your Trakt.tv account, via [the Trakt.tv API.](http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/)
To get more information about each show or movie, the plugin also uses [the TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

**Traktivity is not endorsed or certified by TMDb or Trakt.tv.**
