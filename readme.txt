Log your activity on Trakt.tv.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to log your watched TV series on Trakt.tv.

Right now it only logs data. In the next version you will get ways to display that data on your site.

**Questions, problems?**

**Credits**

The Traktivity plugin gets most its data from your Trakt.tv account, via [the Trakt.tv API.](http://docs.trakt.apiary.io/)
To get more information about each show or movie, the plugin also uses [the TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api).

**Traktivity is not endorsed or certified by TMDb or Trakt.tv.**
